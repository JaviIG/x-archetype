## What is this repository for?

The purpose of this repository is to be the starting point to a customer setup using the X
Components. Please take a look at the [documentation](./docs/index.md).

This repository uses [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)
for the versioning. Keep this in mind when you contribute to this project. Also remember to change
the `header` variable in the `.vesionrc.js` file with the client's name if needed.

If you want to contribute to this project please keep in mind that it uses
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for its commit messages and
[commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) as helping tool to generate the commits. Whenever
you want to create a commit, run `npm run commit` and the commitizen wizard will guide you in
writing the commit message.
